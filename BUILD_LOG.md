## 📊 TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Architecture
- **Node.js 18+** with Discord.js v14
- **Triage pattern** for cost control (Flash-Lite filters 70-80%)
- **Webhook-based** multi-agent (not multiple bot tokens)
- **Redis** for semantic caching
- **Firebase** for persistent storage

### Cost Control
- Flash-Lite: $0.00001 per classification
- Gemini Pro: $0.02 per response (only when needed)
- Semantic cache: 40-60% hit rate = $0 cost
- Target margin: $15-40 per customer

### Discord-Native
- Minimal intents (no Administrator)
- Webhook persona switching
- `deferReply()` for <200ms response
- Rich embeds (no walls of text)

---

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: 45% COMPLETE

**Core infrastructure:** ✅ DONE  
**Intelligence layer:** ⏳ Tomorrow  
**Dashboard:** ⏳ Tomorrow  
**Testing/Polish:** ⏳ Tomorrow

**Expected 80%:** Tomorrow morning (as requested)
